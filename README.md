# React Projects Portfolio

This repository is a collection of small React projects I have built as part of my learning journey. Each project helps me understand React better and improve my skills.

## Projects I Have Built So Far

- **Currency Converter:** A simple React app that fetches currency rates and converts amounts between different currencies.

- **PassGenerator:** A password generator app to create strong, customizable passwords.

- **BgChanger:** An app that allows users to dynamically change the background color or image of the page.


## Future Plans

I plan to continue building more projects to deepen my React knowledge and explore:

- Hospital management systems

- Appointment booking applications

- Advanced UI/UX with animations

- Real-world API integrations

## About This Template

This project uses Vite for a minimal React setup, including Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and some ESLint rules.
